**MySQL Database Project**

**Introduction**
Welcome to my MySQL Database design and implementation project. This repository encapsulates a complete journey of designing a relational database from the ground up. It illustrates meticulous attention to schema design, the construction of entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, and the actual creation of tables with a strong emphasis on normalization and maintaining ACID properties throughout the development.

**Project Structure**
The repository is structured with the following files and directories:

* database_schema.mwb - The MySQL Workbench file containing the full database schema.
* database-project-EER-Page.png - Image file showcasing the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram.
* relational-conceptual-Page.png - Image file illustrating the transition from a conceptual model to a relational model.
* scripts.sql - SQL scripts for creating the database schema and initializing the database with tables and relationships.
* Testing.sql - SQL scripts dedicated to testing the database functionalities and ensuring data integrity.
* views.sql - SQL scripts that define views for simplified data access and reporting purposes.

**How to Use**
To use this project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local environment.
* Open MySQL Workbench and import the database_schema.mwb file to visualize the schema.
* Execute the scripts.sql file in your MySQL server to create the database and its tables.
* Use Testing.sql to perform test operations on your database.
* Implement views.sql to create predefined views that can help with reporting and data analysis.

**Features**
* EER Diagram: Visual representation of the database with all entities, attributes, and relationships.
* Normalization: Database design strictly follows normalization rules up to 3NF to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.
* ACID Properties: Transactions are designed to be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
* Testing Scripts: Ensures the reliability and robustness of database operations.
* Views for Efficiency: Simplify complex queries and enhance performance.
